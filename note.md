# Responsive Design Ingredients
1-Fluid Layouts:
 ðŸ‘‰To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)
 ðŸ‘‰Use %(or vh/vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout).
 ðŸ‘‰Use max-width instead of width.

 2- Responsive Units:
 ðŸ‘‰ use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
 ðŸ‘‰ To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically.
 ðŸ‘‰ Helpful trick: setting 1rem to 10px for easy calculation.

  3- Flexible images
  ðŸ‘‰ by default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that.
  ðŸ‘‰ Always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property.

  4- Media queries:
  ðŸ‘‰ Bring responsive sites to life!
  ðŸ‘‰ To change CSS styles on certain viewport width (called breakpoints).
